To embed code in blog - use this:

`<script type="text/javascript" src="http://gist-it.appspot.com/http://github.com/BenjaminArmstrong/Hyper-V-PowerShell/blob/master/Ubuntu-VM-Build/BaseUbuntuBuild.ps1"></script>`

Note - the GitHub link must be http.  HTTPS will not work!

Also - this does not do PowerShell formatting properly, but it is the best thing I have found so far.
